{"name":"Any Mechanism","tagline":"Open Source mechanism repository for the AnyBody Modeling System","body":"### Welcome to the _Any Mechanism_ repository.\r\nThis is a true open source model repository for **non**-biomechanical models for the AnyBody Modeling System. \r\n\r\nThe AnyBody Modeling System is a multi-body software system specifically designed for musculoskeletal (biomechanical) models ([Link](http://www.anybodytech.com/)). Even though the software it-self is commercial it also is accompanied by a large open repository of models (see AnyScript.org ) which have been contributed by research groups from all over the world. However, these models all represent something related to the human body or to biomechanics. \r\n\r\nThis repository contains only non-biomchanical models, small mechanisms and curious linkages. The models are mostly made for fun, and we hope the repository will eventually grow as more people contribute. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
