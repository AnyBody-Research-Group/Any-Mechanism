        <h3>Welcome to the <em>Any Mechanism</em> repository.</h3>

<p>This is a true open source model repository for <strong>non</strong>-biomechanical models for the AnyBody Modeling System. </p>

<p>The AnyBody Modeling System is a multi-body software system specifically designed for musculoskeletal (biomechanical) models (<a href="http://www.anybodytech.com/">Link</a>). Even though the software it-self is commercial it also is accompanied by a large open repository of models (see AnyScript.org ) which have been contributed by research groups from all over the world. However, these models all represent something related to the human body or to biomechanics. </p>

<p>This repository contains only non-biomchanical models, small mechanisms and curious linkages. The models are mostly made for fun, and we hope the repository will eventually grow as more people contribute. </p>
